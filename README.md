# Binary-Tree-Library
A binary tree library that stores domain names and their corresponding IP address using C++. 

This is a binary tree library that uses Object Oriented Programming to create tree nodes that each store a domain name, IP address and its corresponding status (online or offline). 

New nodes can be added to the tree and each existing node can be edited or deleted. 
Valgrind was used to ensure that there are no memory leaks present in this program.
